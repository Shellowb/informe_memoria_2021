%% User centered Desing
@article{Fox2008,
abstract = {A core principle of Agile development is to satisfy the customer by providing valuable software on an early and continuous basis. For a software application to be valuable it should have a user interface that is usable. Recently there has been some evidence that suggests using Agile methods alone does not ensure that an applications UI is usable. As a result, there is currently interest in combining Agile methods with user-centered design (UCD) practices. To support existing empirical evidence that these methodologies co-exist effectively we have conducted a study with participants that have previously combined these two methodologies. Our findings, combined with existing work show that the existing model used for Agile UCD integration can be broadened into a more common model. In this paper we describe three different approaches taken by our participants to achieve this integration. We term these approaches the Generalist, Specialist, and the Hybrid approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Prior work in this area has focused either on algorithmic implementation without understanding how users actually wish to improve the model or on user needs but without the context of a fully interactive system. To address this disconnect, we implemented a set of model refinements requested by users in prior work and conducted a study with twelve non-expert participants to examine how end users are affected by issues that arise with a fully interactive, user-centered system. As these issues mirror those identified in interactive machine learning more broadly, such as unpredictability, latency, and trust, we also examined interactive machine learning challenges with non-expert end users through the lens of human-in-the-loop topic modeling. We found that although users experience unpredictability, their reactions vary from positive to negative, and, surprisingly, we did not find any cases of distrust, but instead noted instances where users perhaps trusted the system too much or had too little confidence in themselves.

We propose a hybrid human-machine data integration framework that harnesses human ability to address this problem, and apply it initially to the problem of entity matching. The framework first uses rule-based algorithms to identify possible matching pairs and then utilizes the crowd to refine these candidate pairs in order to compute actual matching pairs. In the first step, we propose similarity-based rules and knowledge-based rules to obtain some candidate matching pairs, and develop effective algorithms to learn these rules based on some given positive and negative examples. We build a distributed in-memory system DIMA to efficiently apply these rules. In the second step, we propose a selection-inference-refine framework that uses the crowd to verify the candidate pairs. We first select some "beneficial" tasks to ask the crowd and then use transitivity and partial order to infer the answers of unasked tasks based on the crowdsourcing results of the asked tasks. Next we re-fine the inferred answers with high uncertainty due to the disagreement from the crowd. We develop a crowd-powered database system CDB and deploy it on real crowdsourcing platforms. CDB allows users to utilize a SQL-like language for processing crowd-based queries. Lastly, we provide emerging challenges in human-in-the-loop data integration.},

In this paper, we are reviewing related literature and presenting a mobile application system, named Alpha, that utilizes chatbots as smart teaching assistants. The system consists of an artificially intelligent (smart) chatbot, cloud-based database, speech recognition, and web services. We conducted a student survey and a usability assessment of the implemented system. We have integrated our system into a first-year engineering course, and more courses will be added in the future.

All these departments provide various records regarding students. This information could be the general details like student name, address, performance. All the modules in college administration are interdependent. They are maintained manually. So they need to be automated and centralized as information from one module will be needed by another module. Here we developing the website along with an coalition of chat bot. Chat bots typically provide a text-based user interface, allowing the user to type commands and receive text as well as text to speech response. Chat bots are usually stateful services, remembering previous commands in order to provide functionality. When chat bot technology is integrated with popular web services it can be utilized securely by an even larger audience. With that in mind we overhauled the existing student database management system and made necessary improvement to streamline the process. Our work is useful for easy user interface. We are planning to utilize the powerful database management, data retrieval and data manipulation. We will provide more ease for managing the data than manually maintained in the documents.

abstract = {Monitoring academic records at a higher education institution is highly needed by both students and parents of students. Although the system is usually already available in the form of a web site, but it is still considered too complicated because it must involve a troublesome authentication process, especially for parents. Nowadays, chat applications have been very widely used by the community both young people and even the elderly. There are many chat applications that are widely used including WhatsApp, LINE, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger. The chat application provides an Application Programming Interface (API) service for sending or receiving messages. Therefore, the API can be used to create applications (chatbot) that will serve users in the form of chat. In this study, chatbot was built using the services of Telegram. This is because sending messages via Telegram is free. The information to be served is information about students' attendance at lectures, grades, and financial records. With this application, a college can provide facilities for students or parents of students to view academic records easily, cheaply, and can be accessed anytime.

%% CHATBOTS - QUERies
@inproceedings{Ranoliya2017,
abstract = {Chatbots are programs that mimic human conversation using Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is designed to be the ultimate virtual assistant, entertainment purpose, helping one to complete tasks ranging from answering questions, getting driving directions, turning up the thermostat in smart home, to playing one's favorite tunes etc. Chatbot has become more popular in business groups right now as they can reduce customer service cost and handles multiple users at a time. But yet to accomplish many tasks there is need to make chatbots as efficient as possible. To address this problem, in this paper we provide the design of a chatbot, which provides an efficient and accurate answer for any query based on the dataset of FAQs using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Template based and general questions like welcome/ greetings and general questions will be responded using AIML and other service based questions uses LSA to provide responses at any time that will serve user satisfaction. This chatbot can be used by any University to answer FAQs to curious students in an interactive fashion.},
