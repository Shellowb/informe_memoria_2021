 abstract = {As the artificial intelligence (AI) field advances, more research areas within AI are emerging including machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and much more. In the last decade, chatbot technology has emerged as a new area of AI. Chatbot use-cases are surfacing across various sectors including banking, customer services, medicine, and e-commerce. Recently, chatbots have begun being used in education, and the potential advantages are notable. In this paper, we are reviewing related literature and presenting a mobile application system, named Alpha, that utilizes chatbots as smart teaching assistants. The system consists of an artificially intelligent (smart) chatbot, cloud-based database, speech recognition, and web services. We conducted a student survey and a usability assessment of the implemented system. We have integrated our system into a first-year engineering course, and more courses will be added in the future. The system aims to support students' learning processes and engagement in addition to providing real-time 24/7 assistance to students.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses how the software development team at the German Jordanian University (GJU) adopted the project management and software development processes in the ISO/IEC 29110 series to implement a complex Student Information System (SIS). Specifically, it identifies the key points to be taken into consideration in the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases during the iterative and incremental SIS development process. The SIS is a distributed three-tier web-based application that enables registrars to perform various tasks such as system setup, admission, registration, grades processing, graduation, and reporting. It was launched in the first 2015/2016 semester and enabled administration to maintain a comfortable learning environment, assess instructor performance, enhance teaching practices, and improve course content. The results of the system measurements and user survey assert that the SIS is feature rich, easy to use, fast, reliable, stable, highly available, and scalable. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 abstract = {Studies over the past decade have found empirical links between trust in risk management institutions and the risk perceptions and acceptability of various individual hazards. Mostly addressing food technologies, no study to date has explored wider possible relationships among all four core variables (risk, benefit, trust and acceptability) covering a heterogeneous group of hazards. Our prime objective was to ascertain effects among social trust in regulatory entities, and the public's perceived risk, perceived benefit and the degree of acceptability towards both technological and environmental hazards. We also assess whether trust in regulatory authorities is the cause (causal model) or a consequence (associationist model) of a hazard's acceptability for a wide and heterogeneous range of hazards on all four core variables. Using a web-based survey, 539 undergraduates in Chile rated the five variables across 30 hazards. Implications for technology and environmental risk management organizations are discussed. Independent of the magnitude of the perceived risk or benefit surrounding a given hazard, or how knowledgeable the public claim to be of it, the trust sustained in regulatory institutions will either generate or be the consequence of public attitudes towards the hazard.},

In particular, we introduce Curiosity Notebook: an educational application that harvests conversational interventions to facilitate students' learning.

The paper describes the design and development of a conversational agent called EASElective for elective course selection. EASElective is designed to complement existing academic advising services with an online natural language interactive interface that will support a conversation on topics from basic official course data to informal students' opinions. The major design components of EASElective include intent detection, routines for conversation management, dialogue design, sustainable students' opinion collection and analysis, and course information management. The paper also describes a study on the perceived usefulness of EASElective. The findings were found to be largely positive and EASElective has unique functions and characteristics when compared to other conventional academic advising services.},

 abstract = {Many secure systems rely on a “human in the loop” to perform security-critical functions. However, humans often fail in their security roles. Whenever possible, secure system designers should find ways of keeping humans out of the loop. However, there are some tasks for which feasible or cost effective alternatives to humans are not available. In these cases secure system designers should engineer their systems to support the humans in the loop and maximize their chances of performing their security-critical functions successfully. We propose a framework for reasoning about the human in the loop that provides a systematic approach to identifying potential causes for human failure. This framework can be used by system designers to identify problem areas before a system is built and proactively address deficiencies. System operators can also use this framework to analyze the root cause of security failures that have been attributed to “human error.” We provide examples to illustrate the applicability of this framework to a variety of secure systems design problems, including anti-phishing warnings and password policies.},

For a software application to be valuable it should have a user interface that is usable. Recently there has been some evidence that suggests using Agile methods alone does not ensure that an applications UI is usable. As a result, there is currently interest in combining Agile methods with user-centered design (UCD) practices. To support existing empirical evidence that these methodologies co-exist effectively we have conducted a study with participants that have previously combined these two methodologies. Our findings, combined with existing work show that the existing model used for Agile UCD integration can be broadened into a more common model. In this paper we describe three different approaches taken by our participants to achieve this integration. We term these approaches the Generalist, Specialist, and the Hybrid approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

There are many chat applications that are widely used including WhatsApp, LINE, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger. The chat application provides an Application Programming Interface (API) service for sending or receiving messages. Therefore, the API can be used to create applications (chatbot) that will serve users in the form of chat. In this study, chatbot was built using the services of Telegram. This is because sending messages via Telegram is free. The information to be served is information about students' attendance at lectures, grades, and financial records.

 abstract = {Several control systems in safety-critical applications involve the interaction of an autonomous controller with one or more human operators. Examples include pilots interacting with an autopilot system in an aircraft, and a driver interacting with automated driver-assistance features in an automobile. The correctness of such systems depends not only on the autonomous controller, but also on the actions of the human controller. In this paper, we present a formalism for human-in-the-loop (HuIL) control systems. Particularly, we focus on the problem of synthesizing a semi-autonomous controller from high-level temporal specifications that expect occasional human intervention for correct operation. We present an algorithm for this problem, and demonstrate its operation on problems related to driver assistance in automobiles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

The number of chatbots continues to increase these recent years using different languages, tools and platforms and has been used in several domains, such as marketing, education and medicine. One of the most important issues in designing chatbots is its degree of interoperability with human natural language. In this context, we propose in this work a new messenger chatbot design approach based on Wit.ai and Word Sequence kernel in order to improve semantics. Wit.ai is used to detect contexts and concepts while the Word Sequence Kernel is used as a similarity measure between textual conversations taking into account the order of appearance of words in the conversation. A testing educate chatbot has been build which aims to provide FAQBot system for university students and acts as undergraduate advisor in student information desk. The performance of the proposed chatbot was compared to conventional messenger chatbots and showed better results.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the role of visual aesthetics as a key in generating satisfaction in student information system (SIS) users and to discover relationships to other antecedents. This work has also studied how gender discriminates those relationships. Design/methodology/approach: DeLone and McLean's model of information systems success, visual aesthetic and gender socialisation theory are used as a theoretical framework for the study. An explanatory model was proposed based on the previous literature, and then this model was validated using a sample of undergraduate students. Partial Least Squares was chosen as the approach to conduct the statistical analysis. Findings: First, the findings show that the variance explained by the proposed model in user satisfaction of SIS is 67 per cent. Second, visual aesthetics has a significant direct effect on user satisfaction of SIS, but the indirect effect is much higher, through its relationship to system quality and information quality. Third, the results indicate that there are significant differences between men and women in the direct relationship between visual aesthetics and user satisfaction of SIS, and this relationship being much more intense in the case of women. Originality/value: The study highlights the role of visual aesthetics as a variable that explains user satisfaction in information systems; this fact emphasises on the importance of taking into account aesthetics when designing information systems. In addition, the findings support the existence of a novel relationship between visual aesthetics and information quality. Finally, new evidence on gender differences concerning user satisfaction in information systems is presented; this result indicates in the opposite direction to recent studies that imply a certain homogenisation of gender in relation to the perceptions associated with the technologies of the information.},

@article{Romanycia1985,
 abstract = {From the mid‐1950's to the present the notion of a heuristic has played a crucial role in the AI researchers' descriptions of their work. What has not been generally noticed is that different researchers have often applied the term to rather different aspects of their programs. Things that would be called a heuristic by one researcher would not be so called by others. This is because many heuristics embody a variety of different features, and the various researchers have emphasized different ones of these features as being essential to being a heuristic. This paper steps back from any particular research program and investigates the question of what things, historically, have been thought to be central to the notion of a heuristic and which ones conflict with others. After analyzing the previous definitions and examining current usage of the term, a synthesizing definition is provided. The hope is that with this broader account of ‘heuristic' in hand, researchers can benefit more fully from the insights of others, even if those insights are couched in a somewhat alien vocabulary.

 abstract = {Chatbots are computer programs that interact with users using natural languages. This technology started in the 1960's; the aim was to see if chatbot systems could fool users that they were real humans. However, chatbot systems are not only built to mimic human conversation, and entertain users. In this paper, we investigate other applications where chatbots could be useful such as education, information retrival, business, and e-commerce. A range of chatbots with useful applications, including several based on the ALICE/AIML architecture, are presented in this paper. Chatbots sind Computerprogramme, die mit Benutzern in nat{\"{u}}rlicher Spra-che kommunizieren. Die ersten Programme gab es in den 60er Jahren; das Ziel war festzustellen, ob Chatbots Benutzer davon {\"{u}}berzeugen k{\"{o}}nnten, dass sie in Wirklichkeit Menschen seien. Chatbots werden aber nicht nur gebaut, um menschliche Kommunikation nachzuahmen und um Benutzer zu unterhalten. In diesem Artikel untersuchen wir andere Anwendungen f{\"{u}}r Chatbots, zum Beispiel in Bildung, Suchmaschinen, kommerzielle An-wendungen und e-commerce. Wir stellen eine Reihe von Chatbots mit n{\"{u}}tz-lichen Anwendungen vor, einschliesslich mehrerer Chatbots, die auf der ALICE/AIML Architektur basieren.},

@misc{Shum2018,
 abstract = {Conversational systems have come a long way since their inception in the 1960s. After decades of research and development, we have seen progress from Eliza and Parry in the 1960s and 1970s, to task-completion systems as in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) communicator program in the 2000s, to intelligent personal assistants such as Siri, in the 2010s, to today's social chatbots like XiaoIce. Social chatbots' appeal lies not only in their ability to respond to users' diverse requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with users. The latter is done by satisfying users' need for communication, affection, as well as social belonging. To further the advancement and adoption of social chatbots, their design must focus on user engagement and take both intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users should want to engage with a social chatbot; as such, we define the success metric for social chatbots as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building social chatbots from core chat to visual awareness to skills. We also show how XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first generation of humans ever living with artificial intelligenc (AI), we have a responsibility to design social chatbots to be both useful and empathetic, so they will become ubiquitous and help society as a whole.},

@inproceedings{Smith2018,
 abstract = {Human-in-the-loop topic modeling allows users to guide the creation of topic models and to improve model quality without having to be experts in topic modeling algorithms. Prior work in this area has focused either on algorithmic implementation without understanding how users actually wish to improve the model or on user needs but without the context of a fully interactive system. To address this disconnect, we implemented a set of model refinements requested by users in prior work and conducted a study with twelve non-expert participants to examine how end users are affected by issues that arise with a fully interactive, user-centered system. As these issues mirror those identified in interactive machine learning more broadly, such as unpredictability, latency, and trust, we also examined interactive machine learning challenges with non-expert end users through the lens of human-in-the-loop topic modeling. We found that although users experience unpredictability, their reactions vary from positive to negative, and, surprisingly, we did not find any cases of distrust, but instead noted instances where users perhaps trusted the system too much or had too little confidence in themselves.

@article{Wallach2012,
 abstract = {In this chapter we provide an overview of the activities and artefacts of the user- centered design (UCD) methodology – a successful and practical approach to the design of software user interfaces. After tracing its foundational principles (early focus on users, empirical measurement using prototypes and iterative design) back to 1985s seminal paper by Gould and Lewis, we will highlight each of five central categories of design activities (Scope, Analyse, Design, Validate and Deliver) performed in UCD. Potential integration of UCD into two popular categorizations of software development (User Interface First vs. User Interface Later) will be explored and then demonstrated in a real life case study from the field of electronic engineering along with a practical takeaway regarding the relationship of UCD and eLearning.},
